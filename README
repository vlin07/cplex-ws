Build instructions

1. Establish a working Java 1.6 development environment
2. Create folders to hold the two jar files in lib (used below)
3. Download JAXB version and put it somewhere (used below)

4. Export the environment variables below (but point them to the right locations)

export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6)
export OJDBC_HOME="$HOME/lib/java/oracle/ojdbc6"
export OPLALL_HOME="$HOME/lib/java/ibm/cplex"
export JAXB_HOME="$HOME/lib/java/jaxb/2.1/jaxb-ri-20100511"
export PATH=$JAXB_HOME/bin:$PATH

5. run `ant` from the NCL-WS directory.

You can (and should) script this entire process so that a single command
sets the appropriate vars and executes the build.

NOTE:

One important TODO will be to migrate the build to use Maven so 
the open source dependencies can be auto-resolved and downloaded.
